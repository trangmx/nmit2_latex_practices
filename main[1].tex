2008” raised the current debt ceiling to \$11.3 trillion.

Let X1, X2,..., Xn be a sequence of independent and identically
distributed random variables with E[X_i] = \mu \ and $
Var[X_i] = \sigma ^2 < 1, and \ let $
\begin{equation} 
                          S_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
\end{equation}
denote their mean. Then as n approaches infinity, the random
variables \sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)\ converge\ in \ distribution\ to\ a\ normal\ N(0,\sigma^2).
